# ACA-Benchmarking-Script
This repository can be used for speeding up the manual benchmarking of various parameter of the course Advanced computer architecture.
This script is used to generate a shell script which can be used for beginning the benchmarking process.
Changes of parameter values can be easily made and results can be quickly obtained as compared to manually running hundreds of simulation commands manually.
